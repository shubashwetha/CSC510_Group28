## 🎯 Mission Statement

**The Challenge:** Local businesses struggle with inefficient delivery logistics, leading to high costs, delayed orders, and poor customer experience. Order management systems lack location intelligence, making it difficult to optimize routes and group nearby deliveries.

**What We Built:** NeighborhoodPool is a location-based order management platform that intelligently groups nearby orders, optimizes delivery routes, and provides real-time tracking. Our system helps businesses reduce delivery costs by up to 30% while improving customer satisfaction through faster, more efficient deliveries.

**The Benefits:** 
- **For Businesses**: Reduce delivery costs through intelligent order pooling, optimize driver routes, and gain insights through analytics
- **For Drivers**: Efficient routes with multiple deliveries, reduced driving time, and better earnings
- **For Customers**: Faster deliveries, lower costs, and real-time order tracking

**Stakeholders:**
- **Businesses**: Restaurants, stores, and service providers managing deliveries
- **Drivers**: Delivery personnel assigned to routes
- **Customers**: End-users placing and tracking orders
- **Administrators**: System managers overseeing operations and analytics
